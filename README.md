# 🛒 Shopping List

This is my very first Angular project!  
In this app, I put into practice some basic Angular concepts that are great for beginners like me.

## 📚 What you’ll find here

- **🧱 Components:** The app is built as a reusable component (`ShoppingList`) — a fundamental Angular building block.
- **🔄 Two-way data binding:** The input field uses `[(ngModel)]` to sync the user input with the component’s data.
- **🎯 Event handling:** Buttons and form submit trigger methods like adding, removing, or clearing items.
- **📌 Directives:** Uses structural directives like `*ngFor` to loop through the list and display items, and `*ngIf` to conditionally show parts of the UI.
- **🎨 Property binding:** Applies CSS classes dynamically based on item state (`[ngClass]`).
- **🗂️ Services and Models:** Separates data logic with a simple `ListItem` model class.
- **📝 Forms:** Uses Angular forms with `ngForm` to manage input validation and submission.
- **🧩 Angular Material:** Includes Angular Material components (like buttons and icons) to enhance the user interface with a modern and accessible design.

## 🔧 What it does

You can add items to your shopping list, check them off, remove individual items, or clear the whole list. It’s a simple but solid start for anyone learning Angular.
